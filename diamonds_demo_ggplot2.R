#Let's start by adding one variable at a time - starting with the carat variable

# Now let's add price

# Let's add some geoms i.e. geometric objects (geom_point + geom_smooth)

# Adding aesthetics and more variables

#Let's try specifying aesthetics for each geom

#Labels and themes

# Lastly, let's take a look at facets and faceting. By faceting we are generating
# small multiple graphs where each graph is showing a different subset of the data

# What if we wanted to visually examine how price and carat interacts with not
# only cut but also clarity - this is now 4 variables but we only have a 2d grid 
# to work with.
